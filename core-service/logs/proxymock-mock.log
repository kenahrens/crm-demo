running with the following protocol providers:

Provider POSTGRES listening on port [5432 57926]
Provider HTTP listening on port [57928]
Provider HTTPS listening on port [57927]

The socks5/http compatible proxy interface will be available on port 4140. The above mock providers can be
accessed directly, but for simplicity, you may wish to route your application's outbound traffic through
this single endpoint. Configure your proxy settings according to your specific language or library, most
of which can be configured with environment variables:
  export http_proxy=socks5h://localhost:4140
  export https_proxy=socks5h://localhost:4140
  export tcp_proxy=socks5h://localhost:4140
  export grpc_proxy=http://$(hostname):4140

Usage:
  proxymock mock [flags]

Aliases:
  mock, run

Examples:
# source mock data from the default directory (./proxymock)
proxymock mock --verbose

# source mock data from one directory and write responses to another
proxymock mock --in ./my-recordings --out ./mocked-responses

Flags:
  -h, --help                     help for mock
      --in strings               directories to read (recursively) mock files from (default [./proxymock])
      --no-out                   do not write observed mock requests / responses to disk
      --out string               directory to write new mock request / response files to - MATCH, NO_MATCH, AND PASSTHROUGH seen by mock server (default "proxymock/mocked-2025-05-27_17-38-19.299116Z")
      --proxy-out-port int       port where proxymock will listen for outbound connections (your app -> external services) to mock, or passthrough to the real thing when no mock is matched (default 4140)
  -s, --service stringToString   port mapping for mocked backends when predictable ports are needed, for example: --service mysql=3306 --service postgres=5432 (default [])
      --timeout duration         set timeout for the command, like 10s, 5m, or 1h (default 12h0m0s)

Global Flags:
      --app-url string   URL of the speedscale app
      --config string    Config file (default ${HOME}/.speedscale/config.yaml)
  -c, --context string   Uses a specific context from those listed in ${HOME}/.speedscale/config.yaml
      --exit-zero        Always exit with status code 0
  -v, --verbose          Verbose output
