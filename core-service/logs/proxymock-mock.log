running with the following protocol providers:

Provider POSTGRES listening on port [5432 59752]
Provider HTTP listening on port [59754]
Provider HTTPS listening on port [59753]

The socks5/http compatible proxy interface will be available on port 4140. The above mock providers can be
accessed directly, but for simplicity, you may wish to route your application's outbound traffic through
this single endpoint. Configure your proxy settings according to your specific language or library, most
of which can be configured with environment variables:
  export http_proxy=socks5h://localhost:4140
  export https_proxy=socks5h://localhost:4140
  export tcp_proxy=socks5h://localhost:4140
  export grpc_proxy=http://$(hostname):4140
